## DescriptionðŸ¤–:
The same algorithm can be written differently by each developer. The developer's code style becomes their signature.

**<p align="center">Coding is an art, so what do artists listen to while performing this art?</p>**

The **Developer's Playlist** analyzes opened issues on this repository using **GitHub Actions** and collects developers' favorite songs into a collaborative playlist. 

## UsageðŸ“–:
- Open an issue with title **'song request'** (âš  Please be careful about the lowercase 's' âš )
- Write your favorite track to issue's body in format: <artist>-<song>.

## Okay... but why?
I love the power of **Github Actions**. [2021 Github Actions Hackathon](https://dev.to/devteam/join-us-for-the-2021-github-actions-hackathon-on-dev-4hn4) created an excellent opportunity for me to learn this technology. 
  
I hope it becomes a project that everyone will like and share their favorite songs with other developers <img width="30" src="https://media.tenor.com/images/e79b3b95fd5663e36ce7499a54cdfeab/tenor.gif"/>
