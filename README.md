The same algorithm can be written differently by each developer. The developer's code style becomes their signature.

The **Developer's Playlist** analyzes opened issues on this repository using **GitHub Actions** and collects developers' favorite songs into a collaborative playlist. 

## Usage📖:
- Open an issue with title **'song request'**
- Write your favorite track to issue's body in format: <artist>-<song>.

- Enjoy the developers' collaborative playlist!
- You can also keep track of who added which songs by checking out the [contributors](#contributors) section! 
  
## Okay... but why?
I love the power of **Github Actions**. [2021 Github Actions Hackathon](https://dev.to/devteam/join-us-for-the-2021-github-actions-hackathon-on-dev-4hn4) created an excellent opportunity for me to learn this technology. 
  
I hope it becomes a project that everyone will like and share their favorite songs with other developers <img width="30" src="https://media.tenor.com/images/e79b3b95fd5663e36ce7499a54cdfeab/tenor.gif"/>
